The point of the project is to sort through all the data in the measurements folder and find the relevant data points for each file.
each file is measurments of our galaxy from different angles. These measurements are of speed and temprature, the relevant point of data depends on the angle (given in the file name), when the angle is positive then we want the first local maximum from the "left" (from low temp to high), otherwise we are intrested in the first maximum from the right.
But! there is "noise" in the data and to make sure we should only consider the first maximum that is over 30.
However, we are also intrested to in the Half Width Half Maximum point (how long until the speed reaches half of the local maximum), so we need to take note of that.

By the way, this data analysis was used to prove that the visible matter isn't the only matter in our galaxy and is what led us to the possibility of Dark matter.
